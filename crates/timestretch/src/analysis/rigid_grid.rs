//! Rigid beat-grid fitting for quantized (DAW-produced) material.
//!
//! The DP beat tracker follows local onset evidence, which is correct for
//! live material but wanders on hard quantized tracks (gospel stabs,
//! micro-house, broken techno): corpus diagnostics show gross phase
//! misplacement (60–180 ms mean signed error) on exactly the tracks where
//! tracking is hardest — while the detected *tempo* is right on all of
//! them. Commercial DJ software solves this by fitting one rigid grid
//! (constant BPM + phase anchor) and this module does the same: a small
//! BPM search around the tracked tempo × a full phase circle, scored by
//! mean kick-band onset strength at the grid points (kicks define the
//! beat in dance music; full-band novelty is pulled around by hats,
//! snares, and vocal onsets).
//!
//! Adoption is decided by the fit's own decisiveness, not by a raw score
//! comparison against the tracked beats — tracked beats snap to the
//! detected onsets, so they always win a raw comparison even when they
//! are chasing jitter. On rigid material one phase decisively out-scores
//! all competing phases (`phase_lock` high); on genuinely non-rigid
//! material (live drummers, tempo rides) every phase scores about the
//! same and the tracked grid is kept. A smeared-score sanity floor
//! guards against adopting a fit that misses the kicks outright.
