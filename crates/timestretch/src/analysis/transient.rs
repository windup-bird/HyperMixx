//! Spectral-flux transient detection with robust adaptive thresholding.
//!
//! Combines log-compressed spectral flux (frequency-domain onset measure) with
//! an energy-envelope detector (time-domain onset measure) and phase deviation
//! analysis. Log-magnitude compression keeps onsets separable on dense,
//! continuously loud mastered material, where a linear-magnitude detection
//! function plateaus. Candidates are thresholded against a trailing-window
//! `median + k * MAD` (robust to a chronically elevated baseline), with a
//! global relative floor, a MAD floor, and local-peak/masking gates. The
//! energy channel also acts as a gate: sustained tonal material (a held note,
//! a pure tone) has no time-domain onset, so its flux — pure windowing/leakage
//! ripple — is not detected as transients.
//!
//! Phase deviation detection computes the expected phase advance for each FFT
//! bin based on the hop size and compares it to the actual phase, providing
//! ~10ms temporal precision for onset localization (vs ~50ms for magnitude-only
