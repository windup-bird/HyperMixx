///
/// v7: adds [`tempo_candidates`](PreAnalysisArtifact::tempo_candidates).
/// Purely additive — older sidecars stay compatible with an empty list.
///
/// v8: no schema change — bumped (with `MIN_COMPATIBLE_VERSION`) because
/// the rigid-grid beat fit (v0.10.0) materially changed beat positions on
/// quantized material without a version bump, so v7 artifacts are
/// ambiguous: they may carry either the old wandering grids or the new
/// rigid ones. Forcing regeneration disambiguates.
///
/// v9: no schema change — corroborated rigid-grid adoption (ROADMAP
/// Stage 10) changes beat positions on syncopated low-phase-lock tracks
/// (rigid grids now ship where wandering DP grids did), so v8 artifacts
/// for that class are stale.
///
/// v10: no schema change — estimator-disagreement confidence capping
/// (ROADMAP Stage 10 honest low-confidence display): when both rigid
/// adoption gates decline a fit on plausibly quantized material, the
/// stored artifact confidence is capped at 0.5 so hosts can flag the
/// grid. v9 artifacts for that class (e.g. Somebody To Love) carry the
/// old wrongly-confident values and would never trigger the display.
///
/// v11: no schema change — DJ tempo hint range widened 160 → 182 BPM
/// (drum & bass earns the club bonus; ROADMAP Stage 10). Measured
/// corpus impact is marginal (one row's tempo moved 0.04%; the DnB
/// 2/3-metrical-level lock is NOT yet fixed by this), so
/// `MIN_COMPATIBLE_VERSION` stays at 10 — v10 artifacts are not worse
/// than re-analysis.
///
/// v12: no schema change — metrical-level second pass (ROADMAP Stage
/// 10): when the 3/2 tempo candidate's salience clears a measured
/// threshold, tracking re-runs with the prior centered at that level.
/// Drum & bass now detects its true ~174 tempo instead of the 2/3
/// sub-level; v11 artifacts for that class carry wrong-tempo grids and
/// are worse than re-analysis, so `MIN_COMPATIBLE_VERSION` rises too.
///
/// v13: no schema change — sustained low-band ENERGY joins the downbeat
/// accent (both electors). Flux/onset features tie on four-on-floor
/// material (every beat carries an equal kick) and the log-difference
/// onset actively favors the snare, so cached downbeats for that class
/// sit on beats 2/4 — a DJ host's auto-cue lands on a snare instead of
