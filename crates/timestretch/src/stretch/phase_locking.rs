//! Phase locking algorithms for the phase vocoder.
//!
//! Provides identity phase locking (Laroche & Dolson 1999) with full-spectrum
//! trough-bounded influence regions, region-of-influence locking with adaptive
//! SNR-weighted phase clamping, and a selective confidence-weighted blend mode.
//!
//! ## Full Identity Phase Locking
//!
//! Traditional identity phase locking assigns each non-peak bin to its nearest
//! peak and copies the peak's phase rotation. This implementation improves on
//! that by using **trough-bounded influence regions**: each peak's influence
//! extends to the spectral troughs (local minima) on either side, which
//! naturally captures the full width of each spectral lobe.
//!
//! For each peak `p` with influence region `[start, end]`:
//! ```text
//! phase_rotation = synth_phase[p] - analysis_phase[p]
//! for each bin b in [start, end], b != p:
//!     synth_phase[b] = analysis_phase[b] + phase_rotation
//! ```
//!
//! This preserves the relative phase relationships between a peak and all bins
//! in its spectral lobe, eliminating the inter-bin phase incoherence that
//! causes "underwater" or "phasey" artifacts on polyphonic material.
