//! The keylock chain as one composed stage: band split → (low: delay,
//! high: SOLA corrector) → re-sum, fading to plain varispeed at extreme
//! rates.
//!
//! The low band is corrected by its own time-domain SOLA-class corrector
//! (`BassSola`, ROADMAP Stage 21 — the Stage 2 "un-keylocked low band won"
//! verdict rejected a VOCODER bass; the time-domain corrector won the
//! blind re-match in all four ±8% conditions). It blends against the
//! pitch-follow delayed copy with the SAME per-frame weight as the high
//! band, so the live keylock toggle and the extreme-rate fade move both
//! bands together.
//!
//! The high band is corrected by the time-domain `SolaCorrector` across
//! the ENTIRE corrected range. The chain originally carried a small-FFT
//! phase-vocoder corrector for wide deviations, selected by threshold with
//! a phase-aligned handoff; three owner listening passes (2026-07) rejected
//! the PV at every boundary it was placed behind (phasey/robotic mids and
//! highs at 5%, 9.7%, and 14.1%), and it was deleted at Stage 9. Beyond
//! [`CORRECTION_FADE_START_DEV`] the correction fades toward raw varispeed
//! (deck-stop/spinback territory, where pitch SHOULD follow tempo), with
//! SOLA's transposition clamp soft-flattening the corrected copy so it
//! stays a single coherent pitch through the fade.
