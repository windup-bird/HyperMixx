//! Time-domain SOLA pitch corrector for small transpositions.
//!
//! At DJ transpositions (|T − 1| below ~5%) a splice-based corrector is
//! transparent on transients and needs no FFT: the output reads from a ring
//! of recent band audio at rate `T` (windowed-sinc interpolation), and when
//! the read cursor drifts from its nominal lag the corrector splices — a
//! correlation-matched jump with an equal-power crossfade, placed at
//! low-energy moments when possible (onset snapping deepens in Stage 4).
//!
//! The nominal lag is the keylock chain's constant latency (see
//! `KEYLOCK_LATENCY_FRAMES`): the SOLA algorithm itself only needs the
//! sinc margin (~0.5 ms), but the elastic drift triggers and splice
//! search need real headroom behind the cursor, and the low band's
//! matching delay is anchored on the same figure.
//!
//! Splice decisions are made once per block on the channel mix and applied
//! to every channel identically, keeping the stereo image intact.
